House: the problem is, if i can't trust you, i can't trust your statement that i can trust you. but thanks, you've been a big help.*

House: i need two days of outrageous sex with someone obscenely younger than you. like half your age.*

Foreman, how are you fixed for cash? steal any cars lately?*
Lola: even if real human contact is something you don't have, or even want, or need, you should at least be able to see it in other people
House: right. true love. that's just how we match organs these days. there's a couple in france, high school sweethearts, they're trading brains.*
Let me talk to shipping. i speak their language. foul.*

House: mr. adams, would you step outside for a moment?
Adams: why?
House: because you irritate me.*

House: how are we doing on cotton swabs today? if there's a critical shortage, i could run home
Cuddy: no you couldn't
House: nice.*
Her leg hurts after running six miles. who knows? could be anything.*
Treating illness is why we became doctors. treating patients is actually what makes most doctors miserable.*
