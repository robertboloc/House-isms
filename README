How To Install:
---------------
- Use the .rmskin that i provide for one click install

------
Notes: 
------
- contains 1000+ quotes from the official House M.D. website
- the skin updates the quotes every 15 minutes, if you want a lower (or higher) rate of refresh, feel free to modify the 'Update' variable from the 'House-isms.ini' file. The measure is miliseconds.
- if you want to remove or add quotes, you can modify the 'quotes' file in the skins folder. Remember to use the token '*' after each quote!
- i do not recommend to modify the 'W' or 'H' measures because if the area is too small the text can be cut off! But feel free to experiment, the sizes defined by me guarantee that the quotes will not be cut off.
- if you intend to modifiy and rebuild the .rmskin be sure to remove the .gitignore files from the empty folders
