Thanks for downloading my skin, and for reading this:)

---------------
How To Install:
---------------
- first install the costum font to your system ('HouseMod' file)(to install a font just drag it to your fonts folder, or open it and press install)
- then copy the "House-isms" folder to your Rainmeter Skins folder (that is located in your documents)
- restart Rainmeter so it can detect the new font
- enjoy the house-isms:P

------
Notes: 
------
- contains 1000+ quotes from the official House M.D. website
- the skin updates the quotes every 15 minutes, if you want a lower (or higher) rate of refresh, feel free to modify the 'Update' variable 
 from the 'House-isms.ini' file. The measure is miliseconds.
- if you want to remove or add quotes, you can modify the 'quotes' file in the skins folder. Remember to use the token '*' after each quote!
- i do not recommend to modify the 'W' od 'H' measures because if the area is too small the text can be cut off! But feel free to experiment, 
 the sizes defined by me guarantee that the quotes will not be cut off.
