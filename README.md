#### Installation
Download the [.rmskin](https://github.com/downloads/robertboloc/House-isms/House-isms.rmskin) for one click install

#### About
Contains 1000+ quotes from the official House M.D. website  

The skin updates the quotes every 15 minutes, if you want 
a lower (or higher) rate of refresh, feel free to modify 
the **Update** variable from the [House-isms.ini](https://github.com/robertboloc/House-isms/blob/master/Skins/House-isms/House-isms.ini)
file. The measure is miliseconds.  

If you want to remove or add quotes, you can modify the 
[quotes.txt](https://github.com/robertboloc/House-isms/blob/master/Skins/House-isms/quotes.txt)
file in the skins folder. Remember to use the token '*' 
after each quote!  

I do not recommend to modify the **W** or **H** measures 
because if the area is too small the text can be cut off!
But feel free to experiment, the sizes defined by me 
guarantee that the quotes will not be cut off.  

If you intend to modifiy and rebuild the .rmskin be sure 
to remove the .gitignore files from the empty folders
